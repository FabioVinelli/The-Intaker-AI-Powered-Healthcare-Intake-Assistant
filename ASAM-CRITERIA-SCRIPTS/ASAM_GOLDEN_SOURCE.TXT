For **Mission 3 (The Deterministic Scoring Engine)**, you have three "Golden Source" files among your uploads. They map perfectly to the three Python modules you need to build.

Here is exactly how to use each file to build the specific components of the engine:

### 1. `Full_ASAM_Script_logic_scores_placement.txt`

**Role:** **The Logic Blueprint (Algorithm)**
**Use this to build:** `services/scoring-engine/loc_rules.py`

* **Why it is useful:** This file contains actual **pseudocode** (e.g., `if overall_risk_score >= 3.5...`). It explicitly defines the "placement logic"—how to take a raw score and turn it into a "Level of Care" recommendation (e.g., "Level 3.7 Residential").
* **Action for Agent:** "Translate the `level_of_care_determination` pseudocode in this text file directly into Python functions."

### 2. `The Intaker - Comprehensive Documentation....docx`

**Role:** **The Trigger Map (Scoring Rules)**
**Use this to build:** `services/scoring-engine/scorer.py`

* **Why it is useful:** This document links **Patient Questions** to **Dimensions**. It tells you *what* the system asks and *what* it listens for (e.g., "Are you experiencing tremors?").
* **Action for Agent:** "Use the 'Follow-Up' and 'Dynamic Adjustments' sections to create the keyword triggers. If the user answers 'Yes' to the 'tremors' question in D1, that is a hard rule for `severity += 2`."

### 3. `021122-asam-paper-criteria.pdf`

**Role:** **The Schema Authority (Truth)**
**Use this to build:** `services/scoring-engine/asam_schema.py`

* **Why it is useful:** This is the official ASAM instrument. It is the only file that effectively "stops the drift" on Dimension names. It defines exactly what "Dimension 4" is vs "Dimension 6" officially.
* **Action for Agent:** "Use this PDF to define the `Enum` classes for the 6 Dimensions and the 0-4 Severity Scale definitions. Do not invent new names; copy them exactly from this form to ensure compliance."

**Summary for your Agent:**

* **PDF** = The Dictionary (Definitions)
* **DOCX** = The Ears (Listening Triggers)
* **TXT** = The Brain (Decision Logic)
